I thought it was finally time to start a blog in order to centralise the different notes I have across multiple locations.
This blog is designed to be a general repository for all the random thoughts/notes I have collated over time as well as a reference to any research/scripts I am developing.

Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter or Discord if you have any feedback.
